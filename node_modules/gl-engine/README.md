# gl-engine

This project is an experimental ES6 WebGL engine built on [stack.gl](https://stack.gl/). It tries to combine the small-repo / big-repo philosophies together providing an easy to use environment. The API is built to be composable with the magnificent tools on NPM, while opinionated and centralized in a way to get things done quickly. It's built to be friendly for new users to hack on right away, but provide the raw power needed for expert uses. Shader code will be a first class citizen in the API.

## Note on Name Change

As of Feb. 8, Glam Engine was renamed to gl-engine. There was already an excellent WebGL project called [glam](https://github.com/tparisi/glam) and I didn't realize it when I was reserving the name on npm. After some confusion I decided to rename this project.

## Dive In

* [Getting Started and Installing](https://github.com/gl-engine/gl-engine/tree/master/docs/getting-started.md)
* [Examples](https://github.com/gl-engine/gl-engine/tree/master/docs/examples.md)
* [API Documentation](https://github.com/gl-engine/gl-engine/tree/master/docs)

## Example Code

```javascript
import Bunny from 'bunny'
import { Mesh, PerspectiveCamera, FlatMaterial, Scene, Geometry, Engine } from 'gl-engine'

Engine(function onReady(engine, scene) {
  var camera = PerspectiveCamera()
  var material = FlatMaterial({ color : [0.1,0.3,0.4] })
  var geometry = Geometry(Bunny)
  var mesh = Mesh(geometry, material)

  scene.add(camera)
  scene.add(mesh)

  mesh.position[1] = -5
  camera.position[2] = 20

  engine.on('update', function(e) {
    mesh.euler[0] = e.elapsed * 0.0001
    mesh.euler[1] = e.elapsed * 0.001
    scene.render(camera)
  })
})
```
Then you will get a [spinning flat bunny](http://requirebin.com/?gist=TatumCreative/40970c039f8c0ce44ae2).
